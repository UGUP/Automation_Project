# Automation_Project

This is a Devops assignment where I am trying to implement the concepts learned so far related to the following :-
1) Linux and Bash scripting
2) Networking fundamentals
3) DevOps - Git, Web servers and AWS services. 

Using AWS Services I will be setting up the necessary infrastructure on AWS. I have also uploaded a automation.sh script here which will take care of 
the autodeployment of the web server on Linux machine and will also archieve the logs of the web server and place it into the S3 bucket.
I have also uploaded a script to Automate Daily routine tasks.

Steps to follow to execute the Script in your EC2 machine.

1)go to /root using cd /rootcommand

2) mkdir Automation_Project 

3) Place the script in Automation_project folder 

4) Run sudo su command 

5) run chmod +x automation.sh script 

6) run the scriopt using  sh automation.sh command
